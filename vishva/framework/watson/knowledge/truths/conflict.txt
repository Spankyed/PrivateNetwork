nature of conflict..
doubt is perspective. it is stopping the movement by moving with it. it is respect. it is relation.when one doubts what another says they are totally in perspective

as long as their is division between memory and the observer there is conflict. wherever there is isolated action, solitary aspirations, that very solitude is an act of seperation- this must inevitably create conflict, not just for himself, but for others. 

you might say we are always in conflict
just as the tree is in competition for light in a forest.
each man seeking his own ambition produces conflict.

id say to get peace, you must understand this nature of conflict. and only free men can negotiate 

the only way to deal with conflict it to understand this very nature of it. 

we are a continuation of memory. its the the observer and the observed.

we created this chaotic flow of our society. constant movement from outer to inner, inner to outer. water is water. it goes out and comes in. action and reaction. you hit me i hit me you back.can this movement end
