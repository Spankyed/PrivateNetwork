When I was young I stumbled across game forums with users who had custom signatures in their posts. I began creating signature graphics in photoshop. Acquired a large amount of technical prowess from 12-14 designing forums signatures in photoshop. Around the age of 13, I tried to create a video game private server. Got debilitated learning java and strayed away from coding for a large portion of my teen years. Found a very open community and started writing scripts for programs to automate video gameplay around 16. I attend PBSC where I began studying comp eng. Currently, I am studying javascript libraries, and am very interested in 3d rendering on the web using js libraries that leverage webgl, specifically bablyonjs. 


I've designed a timer app, todo app, and Get Weather app that fetches temperature from a weather API. They are all written in React, following an online course.  I've gained alot of my programming experience writing scripts in Pascal for a program to automate video gameplay. The program uses color reflection and grid systems as a base functionality for automating gameplay (i.e. find color in certain region of grid). I wrote numerous scripts for different video games, and even administrative tasks like data entry.  I've also written machine learning programs in both R and Python to predict values given a training dataset. This was done following a data science mooc.
