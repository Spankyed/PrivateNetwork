Helped record minutes at meetings. Assisted in the annual poppy drive to raise money for veterans in need. Provided the organization with a young face. 

Being apart of the VFW has helped instill in me a servitude to communities of all backgrounds. The veterans shared with me their identity, leaving a profound imprint unto my own.
