My dream is to design, develop, and appropriate technologies to make education more individualistic, and therefore, more effective. Currently I'm capable of building machine learning models in both the R and Python languages. Too, I have intermediate programming knowledge of C & C++. I've taken courses on DB & network administration, multivariable calculus and linear algebra.  

I am pursuing an understanding of the methods for mining and modeling the increasing amounts of fine-grained data becoming available about learners. I want to then be able to use these datasets and models to analyze ways to help improve education in this shifting landscape of learning.

After, I want to move to more demanding endeavors, such as the challenges of massive and persistent world poverty and the stress on our natural systems. My focus will be on bringing into continuing relations ideas concerning the vitality of connecting resources and information to disparate places.
