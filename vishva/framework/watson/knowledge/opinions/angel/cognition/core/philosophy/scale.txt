see what works and scale up
skateboarding

you cant start off with too much sheep. instead of starting with 100 start with 5. You have to treat them like its going to be 500. automated systems

make mistakes small. systemise all companents bouncers door people, the ropes, certain promotion
scarcity, markey siterelease. app release of initial 25 ppl. than 50 100 

dont treat it like its a hobbie, treat it as to prepare to scale up

i dont like going to other people party cus its about them. inv a friend over scalability
