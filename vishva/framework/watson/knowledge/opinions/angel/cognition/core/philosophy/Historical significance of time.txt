The concept of angular momentum relates to the effect of a force of energy, or motion. Meaning its necessarily caused by there having been a force. The visual stimulus of this energy is actively percievable. Time seems to be of a different domain than that of energy(&.: matter and space). While it too is actively percievable, time seems to rather arbitrate energy, rather than stand affected by it. This is to say that time transcends the norms of our everyday experiences, while still seeking there accordance .

At the turn of the 20th century there was a significant cultural need to conquer this notion of time on even an artificial, shallow, synchrozational level, thanks to very prominent economic, industrial, and technological revolutions of the time. However, this need only bred and incubated our modern understanding of time. The signifcance of time and its correlation to our world of experiences has maintained throughout history for it is fundemental to human existence.
