Great, well, my name is Angel. Student at PBSC studying Computer science and Eng. Just passed some hard math classes. Very passionate and interested computers, how they store and compute data- how algorithms get a system to function how it should; this was cultivated when I was young through video game communities.  What I'm more interested in and what keeps me up at night is how these technologies will shape our culture and identity- not always technology. But for the sake of articulating a career motivation I'll say that I am most interested in the interaction between humans and technology. and the future of technology is in the use of data to help humans make decisions, this job fundamental.
