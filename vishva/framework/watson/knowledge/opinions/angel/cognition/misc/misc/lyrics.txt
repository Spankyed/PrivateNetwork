i dont really care baby 

you can still do what u wanna do you gotta trust that sht



we tied together, we tied forever
be honest

onlyt1ime im feeling fine is when im on my shit
and i stay up on mine forever
thats right this shts ride or die
i hateit being stuck in palm beach
but i fly like feathers
and whaterver the work is ima work it better

regardless

im always on time 
regardless im always on grind



gave me the plan and then told me to trust that shit
turned it down qucik i know when to hush a bich

they wana tell me how to live hush that bitch
they wanna put me on edge but i done jumped the cliff
