leave a presence wherever i go
u feel that, i was jus here a second ago

this aint no cave in
save the small talk for the sane men 
jumped off the porch said i cant win
now im going off like they payed him

all they say is he cant move
if they wanna test cause i got a pencil

instead of a movie I thought about a comedy show. just want someone to talk at me tho


ever told mom u dont believe in god
saw the look in her eyes 
wasnt even suprise

im here for you
theres room for two
i made my move 
now can you choose

it may sound rude
but shit aint cool
without the groove
without the mood
we cant get by
we need the high
we gotta try

you make me smile
everythings worthwhile

i cant runback
its like a track
thats stuck on play
the song is cray 
but dammit girl
you are the world


so maybe write
