got called narrow minded by good friend 
im one of the most open-minded people i know
skepticism is no resting place for reason
my environment oriented me towards being narrow minded to what society considered open minded activities.

maybe im wrong, and my cartman logic,
if u didnt get that joke i just wanna say,
glad that you could make it today
