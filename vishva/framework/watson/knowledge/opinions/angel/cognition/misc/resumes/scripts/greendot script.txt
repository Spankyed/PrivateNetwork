Palm Beach County’s Division of Victim Services is the proud recipient of a five-year, $625k grant from the Florida Department of Health to implement the Green Dot Strategy. The goal is that within five years, all 6,000 (and growing) county employees will be trained in how to implement the Green Dot Strategy; and will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to reduce—and possibly eliminate—instance of power-based personal violence in our community. 

We are seeking an intern in our West Palm Beach office to assist with the administrative coordination of the program, as well as the on-site set-up and delivery of training.
