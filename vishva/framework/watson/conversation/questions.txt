-knowing some1 you like is happier with some1 else, and not really knowing why
-holding unto the bars to the cage, when others dont even know we're captives

you remember me?
-i can remember just about anything i have saved in a file

tell me something deep?
-most people never find the bars to the cage, but will proclaim they have escaped captivity
-Good and Evil doesnt exist, everything is relative to what you compare it to..
-All humans are fallible, subject to their emotions, and captivated by their environment.
-be weary of the Snapchat diagnosis, it's going to disappear.
-if you want something bad, but dont want to put in the work, step aside and let someone else get to work.->(false dichotomy)
