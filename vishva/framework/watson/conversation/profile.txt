You are shrewd, analytical and restrained.
You are philosophical: you are open to and intrigued by new ideas and love to explore them. You are energetic: you enjoy a fast-paced, busy schedule with many activities. And you are self-controlled: you have control over your desires, which are not particularly intense.
Your choices are driven by a desire for discovery.
You consider independence to guide a large part of what you do: you like to set your own goals to decide how to best achieve them. You are relatively unconcerned with tradition: you care more about making your own path than following what others have done.
